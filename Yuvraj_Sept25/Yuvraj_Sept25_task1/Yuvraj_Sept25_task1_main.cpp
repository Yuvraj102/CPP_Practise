/*
(SavingsAccount Class) Create a SavingsAccount class. Use a static data member annual- InterestRate to store the annual interest rate for each of the savers. Each member of the class con- tains a private data member savingsBalance indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit. Provide member function calculateMonthlyInterest that calculates the monthly interest by multiplying the balance by annualInterestRate divided by 12; this interest should be added to savingsBalance. Provide a static member function modifyInterestRate that sets the static an- nualInterestRate to a new value. Write a driver program to test class SavingsAccount. Instantiate two different objects of class SavingsAccount, saver1 and saver2, with balances of $2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively. Set the annualInterestRate to 3 percent. Then calculate the monthly in- terest and print the new balances for each of the savers. Then set the annualInterestRate to 4 per- cent, calculate the next monthâ€™s interest and print the new balances for each of the savers.
